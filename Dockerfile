# No package manager in the runtime image. The venv is built by uv in the
# builder stage and copied in, so pip is never invoked here. What the base
# image's pip does ship is vendored copies of other projects
# (pip/_vendor/vendor.txt: msgpack 1.1.2, setuptools 70.3.0), which Trivy
# flags (GHSA-6v7p-g79w-8964, CVE-2025-47273, CVE-2026-59890) and which no
# lockfile bump can reach, because they are not in any lockfile. Removing pip
# closes them at the root and takes an install primitive away from anyone who
# lands code execution in the container. Same structural fix as the frontend
# image, where npm/corepack/yarn left the runtime stage. The model bake
# further down imports chromadb and runs an inference with pip already gone,
# so a venv that secretly needed it fails the build, not the deployment.

# Bake the ONNX embedding model into the image at build time.
# ChromaDB's DefaultEmbeddingFunction (ONNX MiniLM-L6) lazily downloads its
# model into ~/.cache on first use. At runtime the container has a read-only
# rootfs (see docker-compose: read_only: true), so a first-query download
# fails with `OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/home/secrecon/.cache'`
# and cve_semantic_search raises — taking the agent down on any query that
# hits semantic search. Warming the model here, as the secrecon user, writes
# it into /home/secrecon/.cache during the build (writable) so it is baked
# into the image and present at runtime: no network, no writable cache needed,
# read-only rootfs preserved. Must run after `USER secrecon` so the model
# lands in the runtime user's home, the exact path resolved at query time.
