"""OpenTelemetry tracing setup for the two-process stack.

`setup_tracing(service_name)` is called once from each process's main()
entry point. By default spans go to stdout (no infrastructure needed);
set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (e.g. `http://jaeger:4318`) to ship
them to an OTLP/HTTP backend instead.

What is instrumented automatically:
- httpx outbound calls (every NVD / GitHub / ExploitDB request)
- FastAPI routes (instrument_app must be called from api/stream.py
  after the app is built)

What needs manual spans (in the tool modules):
- Each MCP tool wraps its body with tracer.start_as_current_span. The
  attributes set are tool name and the CVE ID when applicable. Never
  user query text. Never API keys. Never LLM output content.

Trace propagation between the agent process and the MCP server flows
through W3C `traceparent` headers on the HTTP+SSE transport, which
the httpx instrumentation handles automatically on the client side
and FastAPI/Starlette handle on the server side.
