"""In-process denial-of-wallet guard.

A rolling-window ceiling on estimated LLM spend across triage runs. The
per-request round cap (`settings.agent_request_limit`) already bounds a single
run's cost; this bounds the *aggregate* an attacker can drive by repeating
requests against a reachable endpoint.

The window is held in memory (a deque of `(monotonic_ts, usd)` events), so it
resets on process restart. That is a deliberate, documented tradeoff: it bounds
spend *between* restarts, and forcing a restart is itself a much higher bar than
hammering an unbounded endpoint. Persisting the counter (e.g. in the audit DB)
is the production evolution if the deployment needs restart-durable budgets.

The ceiling is read live from `settings` on every call, so a test (or a config
reload) that changes `denial_of_wallet_usd_per_day` takes effect without
rebuilding the tracker.

Concurrency note: `would_block()` (pre-run) and `record()` (post-run) are
separate steps, so N concurrent in-flight runs can overshoot the ceiling by at
most N times the per-run cost. The round cap bounds that per-run cost, so the
overshoot is bounded and acceptable for a rail; it is not a billing ledger.
