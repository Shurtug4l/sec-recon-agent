"""Deterministic SSVC prioritization over the signals the tools returned.

SSVC (Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization) is CISA's methodology
for turning vulnerability signals into a remediation-urgency decision, replacing
"triage by CVSS score" with a decision tree over exploitation status, impact,
and mission context. Its four coordinator outcomes are Act / Attend / Track* /
Track (see agent/schema.py::SsvcDecision).

Why this lives here and not in the LLM:
    The prioritization verdict is a compliance-relevant, safety-relevant signal.
    An LLM is probabilistic; the same CVE could get a different verdict on two
    runs. A deterministic function over the collected signals is reproducible,
    auditable, and testable. The LLM's job is to gather the grounded signals and
    to *echo* the resulting decision in prose; this function is the authority.

Why the signals come from the trajectory, not from the report:
    A verdict computed from the fields the model wrote is deterministic *given
    those fields*, but the fields traverse the model. An injection (or plain
    transcription drift) that flips `in_kev_catalog` in the report would flip
    Act to Track while the function stays "pure". So `assess_ssvc` reads each
    signal from the typed tool returns captured in the run (the same evidence
    index the grounding verifier uses) and consults the report only where no
    usable tool evidence exists for that signal, naming every such fallback on
    the verdict (`basis`, `unverified_signals`). The SBOM gate feeds typed tool
    results directly through `assess_from_signals` and never falls back.

Faithfulness to CISA SSVC (honest scope):
    CISA's decision tree has four points: Exploitation (none / PoC / active),
    Automatable (no / yes), Technical Impact (partial / total), and Mission &
    Well-being (low / medium / high). This project has clean signals for
    Exploitation (KEV = active, public-exploit = PoC) and a defensible proxy for
    the likelihood axis (EPSS). It does NOT have deployment-specific Mission &
    Well-being context (a stateless triage tool cannot know the operator's
    asset criticality), and it uses ransomware association + CVSS severity as
    coarse impact escalators rather than the full Technical-Impact point. The
    mapping below is therefore SSVC-*informed*, not a certified SSVC
    implementation. That distinction is stated in the docs and the report
    rationale rather than hidden.

Thresholds are module constants so the decision boundaries are inspectable and
unit-testable, and they align with the prioritization heuristic already stated
in the agent system prompt (EPSS >= 0.5 or percentile >= 0.95 = high real-world
risk; the audit trail's high_epss_hits uses the same 0.5 cut).
