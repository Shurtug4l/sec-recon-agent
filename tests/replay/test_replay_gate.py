"""Record-replay merge gate.

Replays every committed cassette (tests/cassettes/) through the CURRENT
deterministic pipeline and asserts it reproduces the outcomes computed at
record time. Runs in the fast suite, so it is part of the required CI
check: a PR that changes trajectory extraction, grounding, SSVC, the
report schema, or the golden scorer gets validated against real recorded
LLM behavior at zero LLM cost.

The staleness test hard-fails when the LLM-visible surface (system prompt,
MCP tool schemas, TriageReport schema) no longer matches the hash stamped
in the cassettes: the frozen trajectories describe a model that saw a
DIFFERENT surface, so their replay would prove nothing. Re-record with
`make record-cassettes` (bills the LLM; see CONTRIBUTING.md on
behavior-bearing text).
